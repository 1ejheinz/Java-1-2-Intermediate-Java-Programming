     * Suppose you want to deposit a certain amount of money into a savings account, 
     * and then leave it alone to draw interest for the next 10 years. At the end of 10 years,
     * you would like to have $10,000 in the account. How much do you need to deposit today to make that happen?
     * You can use the following formula, which is known as the present value formula.
     *
     * The terms in the formula are as follows:
     *
     * P is the present value, or the amount that you need to deposit today.
     *
     * F is the future value that you want in the account. (In this case, F is $10,000.)
     *
     * r is the annual interest rate.
     *
     * n is the number of years that you plan to let the money sit in the account.
     *
     * Write a method named presentValue that performs this calculation. 
     * The method should accept the future value, annual interest rate, and number of years as arguments. 
     * It should return the present value, which is the amount that you need to deposit today. 
     * Demonstrate the method in a program that lets the user experiment with different values for the formulaâ€™s terms.
     *
     * @param futureValue The future value desired in the account
     * @param annualInterestRate The annual interest rate
     * @param years The number of years the money will sit in the account
     * @return The present value, or the amount to deposit today
